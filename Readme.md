TrueWE 1.0


Motivation
Human life has been significantly impacted by revolutions that happened in the past. The agricultural revolution allowed humans to understand the principles of growing, which resulted in more time being spent on the growing phase rather than consumption. This coexistence had the benefit of evolving human consciousness due to its new interaction with the cycle of life. The Industrial Revolution allowed humanity to expand and discover more, but inevitably small communities became more centralized, bringing new demands. As we transitioned from a natural to an anthropogenic world, we adopted a human-centered lifestyle and forgot about life's interdependencies. Despite our relatively short presence on Earth, our achievements as humanity are astonishing but not sustainable. 
TrueWE is the collective consciousness that aims for sustainable development based on life, the most sustainable system that we can learn from. As part of TrueWE, it is our responsibility to create a sustainable system that makes our future more resilient and gives meaning to our lives. Together, we can grow and develop a sustainable and scalable system that evolves over time and becomes the best investment for future generations. We are life modelers and responsible users at the same time. We are TrueWE. Welcome to the responsibility era!

TrueWE as an individual: 

We are smart enough to realize the beauty of life and frustrated enough with a corrupted system that offers money as its true return value. We are individuals who want a better world but are also aware of our weaknesses against systematic corruption. We are ready to take responsibility for shaping and developing a fair yet productive system that is sustainable and brings meaning to our lives.

TrueWE as a community:

TrueWE, a registered community on the Transnational Community Federation (TCF e.V.), is focused on sustainable development with the goal of increasing life resilience for communities around the world. Our mission is to develop an interconnected and scalable system that provides meaningful jobs for ourselves and sustains our future. Time is the most valuable asset in our lives, and it should be spent wisely. Under our current corrupted global system, we often find ourselves in meaningless occupations just to survive. Unfortunately, there will be little time left for realizing the meaning of life and truly enjoying it. Focusing on a single task might bring perfection, but life is not about perfection â€“ it's about diversity. Single jobs can be stressful and inefficient, which is why TrueWE encourages individuals to diversify their tasks and develop their own innovative and sustainable ideas while still supervising their original task. This is how we grow!

TrueWE as an organization 

TrueWE develops and offers proposals that aim to increase life resilience in general and takes permanent responsibility for implementation. After community approval, the selected proposal will be publicly funded, and implementation will begin.
